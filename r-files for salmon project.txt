Hey Doug,

Here are files for salmon project. The main r-script is 'salmon_inla_clean.r'. The file, 'source_salmon.r' is needed for running some functions in the main script. The file 'salmon_dataming.r' is the file for generating the two dataset files, 'sockeye_adults_narm_B.csv' and 'sockeye_adults_nazero_B.csv'. So as you can see from the file names, i only use the data from sample B here. The main script here uses the data file 'sockeye_adults_narm_B.csv', as i discussed with Chris that he agrees with you that all NAs of qPCR should be removed. But while I was in Kunming, Yahan has the opinion to treat these NAs as zero. That's why I generate the file 'sockeye_adults_nazero_B.csv' and the plots that I sent to you couple of weeks ago are results of this file.
Answering your question in wechat, the major contribution to have such nice fit is from time-autoregression. That's also why I don't sent you the r-script that I'm implemented using MCMC as I haven't figured out how to write functions for autoregression there. To your notice, in the main r-script, I modeled a model without time-autoregression, 'm.pnt.rela'. 
I'm sure that i must not explain everything that is necessary for you to fully understand my code. Please forgive me if that's the case and do please ask me if you don't understand something there.

Cheers, Yuanheng
